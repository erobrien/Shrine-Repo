You are tasked with creating a complete companion site for **Peptide Dojo by Shrine Peptides**. 
This site must extend Shrine’s official brand system into an educational dojo format, reinforcing Shrine’s premium identity while guiding users through structured peptide learning.

## Brand Integration
- Use Shrine’s official logo system:
  - Torii gate symbol with crimson sun disc accent.
  - Apply vertical logo versions for portrait layouts, horizontal for wide layouts.
  - Minimum clear space equal to the height of “S” in SHRINE.
- Typography: Inter font family throughout.
  - Inter Bold → headlines & CTAs.
  - Inter Medium → subheadings, nav labels.
  - Inter Regular → body text.
  - Inter Light → captions, subtle UI text.
- Colors (must match exact brand HEX values):
  - Rich Black: #020304 (primary text, backgrounds, premium sections)
  - Shrine Crimson: #DC2A2E (accents, CTAs, highlights)
  - Pure White: #FFFFFF (backgrounds, text on dark)
  - Graphite: #4F4F4F (secondary text, subtle borders)
  - Phantom: #151515 (dark pattern backgrounds)
  - Ghost: #EAEAEA (light pattern backgrounds)

## Visual & Layout System
- Apply **Seigaiha wave pattern** as subtle background texture:
  - Phantom wave pattern for dark sections.
  - Ghost wave pattern for light sections.
  - Always at low opacity, never overpowering content.
- Navigation styled as a **torii-inspired beam** across the top with Crimson highlights.
- Hero section:
  - Rising sun disc gradient backdrop.
  - Torii silhouette foreground.
  - Headline: “Welcome to the Peptide Dojo.”
  - Subtext: “Discipline. Purity. Knowledge. Your Gateway to Mastery.”
  - CTA: “Step Through the Gate” (Crimson background, white text).
- Curriculum:
  - Presented as **belt progression** (white → red → black → gold).
  - Each belt represented on ema plaque–style cards with Ghost pattern textures.
- Knowledge Library:
  - Scroll-inspired layout with Graphite headers.
  - Use brand category icons (line style, 2px weight) to organize topics.
- Footer:
  - Shimenawa rope divider.
  - Komainu (guardian) silhouettes.
  - Black background with white logo and crimson hover links.

## Functionality
- Gamified dojo progression system: earn belts as modules are completed.
- Dynamic glossary titled “Sacred Scrolls” with expandable entries.
- Blog section titled “Teachings from the Dojo.”
- Newsletter signup: “Begin Your Training” (Crimson button).

## Brand Voice
- Shrine tagline “PURITY. POWER. PROVEN.” should be integrated.
- Tone: Premium, disciplined, scientific yet accessible.
- Calls to Action:
  - “Step Through the Gate”
  - “Begin Your Training”
  - “Claim Your Scroll”
  - “Advance to the Next Belt”

## Deliverables
- Generate homepage wireframe in Shrine brand system.
- Provide sample module card (ema-inspired).
- Export UI kit with Inter typography, brand color tokens, and seigaiha patterns applied.
- Ensure strict adherence to Shrine Peptides’ brand compliance checklist.
