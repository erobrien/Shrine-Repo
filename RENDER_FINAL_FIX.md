# ðŸš¨ Final Render Deployment Fix

## The Issue
You're getting 502 errors because the Render service isn't properly connected or configured.

## Option 1: Fix Current Service
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3cd9ga4d50c73cf4qug/settings
2. Scroll to "Repository" section
3. Make sure:
   - GitHub repo is connected: erobrien/Shrine-Repo
   - Branch is: main
   - Auto-deploy is ON

## Option 2: Create Fresh Service (RECOMMENDED)
Since we've made many changes, it's cleaner to start fresh:

### Step 1: Delete Current Service
1. Go to Settings tab in Render
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click "Delete Web Service"

### Step 2: Create New Service
1. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Select repository: erobrien/Shrine-Repo
4. Service settings:
   - Name: peptide-dojo (or your choice)
   - Region: Oregon (US West)
   - Branch: main
   - Runtime: Node
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Plan: Free

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these in the Environment tab:
```
NODE_ENV = production
SESSION_SECRET = [click Generate]
```

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service" and watch the logs!

## What Should Happen
1. Render will clone your repo
2. Run `npm install && npm run build`
3. Start with `npm start`
4. You'll see our startup banner:
   ```
   ðŸ¥‹ PEPTIDE DOJO ðŸ¥‹
   ```

## If Still Having Issues
The problem might be the repository has too many test files. Let's clean up:

1. Delete these test files locally:
   - simple-server.js
   - server/minimal-test.js
   - test-deployment.js

2. Commit and push
3. Redeploy

## Success URL
Once working, your app will be at:
https://[your-service-name].onrender.com

The health check will be at:
